 1. Open [a clock](clock.html), and record it briefly in your livestream.
 2. Watch your live stream and find back a frame where you can read your clock from step `1.`
 3. Note the timecode of that frame.
 4. Subtract the timecode of `3.` from the value you read in `2.`. This is the time you will have to subtract from the current time on your clock to get the corresponding timecode in your livestream.
